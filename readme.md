1.	Write a Python program to input an amount (integer) and determine the minimum number of notes required to make up that amount using denominations of 2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1.
a.	Prompt user input
b.	Use conditionals and loops to calculate notes
c.	Handle edge cases (e.g., 0 or negative inputs)

2.	Build a menu-driven scientific calculator that performs operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power for:
a.	Float numbers
b.	Complex numbers
Implement validation for invalid operations
3.	Write a program that simulates an invoice generator for a small shop. It should:
a.	Accept item details: name, quantity, unit price
b.	Calculate item total and apply 18% GST (use Decimal for accuracy)
c.	Show the final bill with a breakdown
Use loops to accept multiple items. Use Decimal for calculations. Print formatted output using alignment
4.	Create a program that takes temperatures in Fahrenheit for 7 days, converts them to Celsius, and finds:
a.	Highest and lowest temperatures
b.	Average temperature
c.	Number of days below 20Â°C
Use the formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9.  Store results in a list. Use max(), min(), and average calculation. Loop to count specific values
